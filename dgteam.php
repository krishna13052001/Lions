        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dear Ever Serving Leaders,</b><br><br>
          Greetings!! <br>
          All of you already taken the responsibilities of leadership in your Club/ in our District Cabinet.
          <br>
          First, my best wishes to you, the leaders who will reverberate our Lions Club International
          President Lion Dr Jung-Yul Choi with “Kindness in Unity and Diversity” and MCC Lion Girish Malpani’s
          Give More along with District Governor Lion CA Abhay Shastri with “Sow Service Seeds”
          As Ever Serving Leaders, it is important for all of you to serve humanity, keeping in mind Lions
          Club International’s five areas of global causes: Vision, Diabetic, Childhood Cancer, Hunger and
          Environment, alongwith our District Governor’s SARITA program in Activities and Administration. <br>
          The success of your leadership revolves around creating opportunities for your members to serve
          humanity through your projects. As much as creativity and innovation in projects inspire us to serve
          the community, let us not forget to support permanent projects existing in your club, that have been
          consistently successful in delivering the needs of the community. <br>
          It is also important for you as a leader to work closely with the GAT team members, to promote and
          provide an opportunity for those who haven’t embraced Lions, by inviting them to join your club and
          serve humanity. <br>
          The LY year 2020-2021 is the year of challenging, due to COVID-19 pandemic situation. As Ever
          Serving Leaders, I urge you to spread the word, on the good work Lions has done to needy communities
          of this world. Do not shy away from asking people to donate to Lions Club International Foundation
          (LCIF), for worthy global causes that Lions does. <br>
          As office bearers, let us lead to uphold the theme of our year “Sow Service Seeds” and “Give More”
          with to community with Kindness in Unity and Diversity. <br>
          I & Lion Mrs. Sandhya, wish each one of you and the Lions family members, an eventful, fruitful and
          enjoyable year in serving humanity. <br> <br>
          <b>Yours in Lionism,</b> <br>
